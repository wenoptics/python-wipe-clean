 not supported due to lack of `NamedTuples` typing.

```bash
wipe-clean
```

Use `-h, --help` to show all available options

```bash
wipe-clean -h
```

## Advanced usages

You can use wipe-clean inside your project.

```

</details>

### 2. Customization

It's possible to design your own brush shape and animation.

#### Example brush

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

To create a new brush type, implement the `Brush` interface, e.g.

```python
{{ test_readme_examples['test_example_brush'] }}
```

This will define a brush like this:

```text
##
##
```

</details>

#### Example path

Similarly, you can implement the `Path` interface to create a new brush path.

```python

```
